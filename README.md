# About me 

Hi, Iâ€™m Wispy. Passionate about Web3 security, I'm a Developer Relations Engineer (Cooperators) at Mode and currently building my path as a security researcher. I actively participate in contests like Cantina, Code4rena and Sherlock, have completed CTFs, and competed in Secureum races. Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my skills through audits, technical contributions, and continuous learning.
